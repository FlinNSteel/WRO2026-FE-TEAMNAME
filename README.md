# WRO2026-FE-ChompersMunchers
Chompers Munchers is a Panama based team comprised of three students which aim to learn the most of what is possible with our skillsets and aim to learn even more along the way, we are participating in the "WRO FE 2026: Self Driving Cars" challenge. In this documentation you'll be able to find everything about the team and robot, from details on each members to the creations and composition of Notechoques.

## Meet the munchers! 🙌
We can't exactly label anyone with a specific role, as we kind of had every role at once, with everyone helping to build prototypes, code the robot and make sure the robot didn't blow up.
### Leonardo Cubeddu
I worked on the code for the robot and had my hand in the making of "NoTeChoques" (our robot's nickname).Aside from that, my last name is pronounced koo-BEH-doo so please pronounce it right 
*Born*: 2010, Venezuelan
### Ana Lozano
My main job relies on the documentation and research for making the robot come to life, anything from checking rules thousands of times to testing the robot's parameters to make the coding expirience smoother for everyone else on the team.
*Born*: 2010, Panamenian
### Dwight Sutherland
Dwight is our mentor, he guides us along the way laying the basics for everything we do and making sure we can make the most out of what we have.
*Born*: 2001, Panamenian
***
Things we have to put:
- Photos and media of the robot and the team, include videos of robot driving
- Description of how robot works or at least what we did. 
- Code commits like justin case.
 
## Robot overview ⚙️
For our robot, we were aiming for a beginner friendly yet functional design, which is why we used the help of **Pybricks** and **Lego SPIKE** to develop our machine. This was done because, despite the fact we wanted to learn as much as possible, topics like wiring and electronics requiered a skill level we would need more time to reach than we had and we wanted to have the machine working in its best form for the time of the competition as much as we wanted to learn from making it.

### Mechanical Systems 

The robot's steering system was made with mechanical differential drive, with gears ensuring maximum customizability of the robot's speed for the wheels, the steering was done with an acherman directional in the front of the vehicle, with the back being hooked up to a rotatory motor which allows it to quickly adjust the speed of the robot, at least enough for it to do everything we need it to.

### Command based parking
<img width="300" height="300" src="https://github.com/FlinNSteel/WRO2026-FE-CHOMPERSMUNCHERS/blob/main/Media/Parking.gif">

- We based our parking on the *pybricks* system by making a series of commands for the basic actions of **turning** and **moving**, with variables set to control the turn angle, intensity of the movement and distance covered.

- We is use the sensor to detect the distance in the two side (left,right) when it detects which one is the farthest it will activate one of the two codes
  
- If right is the farthest it will go and exit right if left is the farthest then it will exit left
